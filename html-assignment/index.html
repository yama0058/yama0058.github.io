            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Thalyssa Ayumi. I was born in Brazil on September 1<sup>st</sup> in the 00's, in a city called <em>Cuiaba</em>.
                I am Japanese and European mix with both brazilian Parents. My great-grandparents on my father's side were Italian,
                French and Polish. My great-grandparents on my mother's side of the familly were Japanese from <em>Okinawa</em>.</p>
            <P>I have a lot of hobbies. Among them are drawing, singing, dressing up, dancing to Japanese and Korean pop music, making 
            dance choreographies for the songs that I like, traveling, playing video games, and going out to get to know new places.
            My biggest dream is to have my own clothing brand and to know how to do everything with the internet, programming,
            designing, drawing, <abbr title="et cetera">etc</abbr>.</P>
